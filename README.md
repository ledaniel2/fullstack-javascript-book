# Fullstack JavaScript Book

This is a works in progress as the online companion repository to the book
**Fullstack JavaScript: Everything You Need To Node** (ASIN: B0C8PLDS6Q)
available from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PLDS6Q).

Most of the `.html` files can be loaded into a browser and activated, without
the need to explicitly load from a local webserver. Most of the `.js` files
can be run with eg. `node relative/path/to/app.js`, or are automatically
loaded by `webpage.html` in the same directory. Sometimes you will need to
navigate into the directory with eg. `cd relative/path/to`, `node app.js`.

The file `package.json` needs to be found in a parent directory, and allows
`import` to be used with a `.js` file extension. If the `.js` file is copied
outside of the hierarchy and a `package.json` is not present, it must be
renamed to have a `.mjs` extension, eg. `app.mjs`.

The majority of code samples in directory "samples" up to and including chapter 8
should work without modification. Those from later chapters may need valid user
credentials, or creation of a suitable framework or environment, in order to be
run or utilized.

Markdown sources for all of the chapters in the book are now available
to browse online. The command used to build the e-book under Windows 10 using
the "pandoc" program was:
