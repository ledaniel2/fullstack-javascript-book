Note that at the time of writing, with Jest 29.5.0 and Node.js 18.60.0,
simply running "npm test" in this directory does NOT work. Either do:

(Windows)

set NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules
npm test

(or Others)

NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npm test

Also note that the "jest.config.json" file is necessary to be present in
order to use jest.unstable_mockModule().
