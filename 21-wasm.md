# Chapter 21: WebAssembly and Blazor

## Introduction to WebAssembly

### What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly, often referred to as WASM, is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. In simpler terms, it's a type of code that can be run in modern web browsers&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance.

WebAssembly is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, Rust, etc., enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. It's an open standard developed by a W3C Community Group that includes representatives from all major browsers.

### The Benefits of WebAssembly

The primary benefits of WebAssembly lie in its speed, efficiency, and security:

1. **Speed**: WebAssembly provides faster parsing and can be executed at near-native speed, due to its size and format. Unlike JavaScript, WASM is a binary format. Binary data is smaller than text data, hence it's faster for a browser to download. A typical JavaScript function, when converted to WebAssembly, would be represented in fewer bytes, making it quicker to download and load into memory.

2. **Efficiency**: WebAssembly is designed to be a low-level virtual machine that runs code at near-native speed. It has a compact binary format which makes it ideal for execution and decoding.

3. **Security**: WebAssembly is designed to be secure and sandboxed for execution in a web browser, similar to how JavaScript operates. WebAssembly is also designed to be part of the open web platform.

### Real-world Use Cases of WebAssembly

WebAssembly isn't designed to replace JavaScript, but rather to complement and work alongside it. It allows us to take tasks that require a lot of computational resources and offload them from JavaScript, thus freeing up the JavaScript thread to do what it's best at, like manipulating the DOM, responding to user interactions, etc. Here are some of the use cases for WebAssembly:

1. **Heavy computation**: JavaScript isn't the fastest language out there, and for heavy computations like image or video editing, 3D rendering, or scientific simulation, a more performant language like C++ can provide a better user experience. You could write this code in C++ and then compile it to WebAssembly to run in the browser.

2. **Games**: WebAssembly is literally a game-changer for online gaming. High-performance games that were previously only available as native applications can now be delivered over the web.

3. **Web applications**: With the advent of frameworks like Blazor, we can now create entire frontend applications using .NET and WebAssembly, which we'll discuss in the next section.

While WebAssembly is not a magic bullet that will replace JavaScript, it certainly expands the realm of possibilities on the web.

## Understanding Blazor

### What is Blazor?

Blazor is a free and open-source web framework developed by Microsoft. It enables developers to build interactive web applications using C# and HTML, rather than JavaScript, the language traditionally used for client-side web development. This is made possible by running on either WebAssembly in the client's web browser or on the server via SignalR.

The name "Blazor" is a combination of "Browser" and "Razor". Razor is a Microsoft's programming syntax for embedding server-based code into webpages. The server-based code can be written in any .NET language, giving developers the freedom to choose their preferred language, including C#, which is a popular choice.

### Building Web Applications with Blazor

Building web applications with Blazor revolves around the concept of components. Components in Blazor are self-contained chunks of user interface (UI), such as a page, dialog, or form, with associated C# code that handles user interactions. Components are flexible and can be nested, reused, and shared between projects.

Let's create a simple counter component. We'll define a button and a paragraph element that displays the current count. Each time the button is clicked, the counter will increment:

```csharp
<button @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>
<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `@onclick` directive defines an event handler for the button's click event, calling the `IncrementCount()` method. The `currentCount` variable is rendered in the `<p>` element.

### Blazor Server vs. Blazor WebAssembly

Blazor allows for two hosting models: Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.

* **Blazor Server**: The Blazor Server hosting model runs on the server, with user interface updates, event handling, and JavaScript calls happening over a real-time SignalR connection. The application is rendered on the server side and then sent to the client's browser, which updates the UI. The server keeps track of the component hierarchy and maintains the state of the application.

* **Blazor WebAssembly**: The Blazor WebAssembly hosting model runs directly in the browser using WebAssembly. The application, along with the .NET runtime, are downloaded to the client's browser, and the app runs on the client side independently of the server. The entire application is shipped to the client at the start, and subsequent operations do not require server interaction unless the application specifically requires it.

Both hosting models have their own strengths. Blazor Server apps have a smaller download size and can take full advantage of server capabilities, including use of any .NET Core compatible APIs. Blazor WebAssembly apps, on the other hand, can run offline and support more client-side functionalities.

## Comparing Blazor with Other Frontend Frameworks

### Comparison with JavaScript-based Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)

As a framework for building interactive web applications, Blazor often finds itself compared to popular JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. Here's a look at how it stacks up:

* **React**: React, created by Facebook, uses JavaScript to build dynamic, high-performing, client-side web applications. React achieves its speed through a virtual DOM that only refreshes parts of the page, minimizing the use of JavaScript's expensive DOM operations. However, compared to Blazor, React requires you to use JavaScript or TypeScript, which can lead to a lot of type-safety issues that are not present in statically-typed languages like C#. Furthermore, the JSX syntax used by React might feel alien to developers used to HTML-like templates.

* **Angular**: Angular, developed by Google, is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework. It's robust and comes packed with features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a modular architecture. However, this robustness comes with complexity. Angular has a steep learning curve compared to both React and Blazor. If you are a .NET developer and familiar with C#, you might find Blazor's Razor syntax more intuitive and easier to understand than Angular's TypeScript-based syntax.

* **Vue**: Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Its core library is focused on the view layer only and it's easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. However, Vue also suffers from the same type safety issues as React because of its reliance on JavaScript.

Blazor, unlike these three frameworks, allows developers to write client-side logic in C#, reducing the need for JavaScript. The use of a single language, C#, across the stack can lead to significant productivity gains and fewer context switches for developers. However, because Blazor is still relatively new, its ecosystem and community support aren't as developed as those for React, Angular, or Vue.

### Comparison with other WebAssembly frameworks (Rust, C++)

WebAssembly allows developers to run languages other than JavaScript in the browser. Blazor leverages this with C#, but there are also frameworks that use other languages:

* **Rust**: Rust is a language designed for performance and safety, particularly safe concurrency. The Rust and WebAssembly toolkit allows developers to build high-performance web apps with Rust. Compared to Blazor, Rust has a steeper learning curve and is less well-suited to building UIs due to its systems programming focus.

* **C++**: With tools like Emscripten, developers can compile C++ code to WebAssembly and run it in the browser. This is great for porting older C++ applications or building high-performance web apps, but C++ lacks the high-level features and easy syntax of C#, making it a more complex option for web development.

Overall, Blazor offers a more user-friendly approach to building WebAssembly-based web applications compared to Rust and C++. It allows developers to use their existing .NET and C# skills to build performant web applications that run on any modern browser without plugins.

## Advanced Topics in Blazor

### Routing in Blazor

Blazor has a built-in routing system that follows a simple and flexible approach. The `@page` directive, which is included in each Blazor component, helps the Blazor router to know which component to display based on the URL's path.

For example, consider a component named `HelloWorld.razor` with the following code:

```csharp
@page "/hello"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

Here, the `@page` directive indicates that this component should be displayed when the user navigates to the `/hello` path.

In addition to basic routing, Blazor also supports route parameters, allowing you to capture values from the URL. The route parameter is defined using the syntax `{Parameter}`. For example:

```csharp
@page "/greeting/{name}"

<h1>Hello, @Name!</h1>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

The above component will be displayed when the user navigates to `/greeting/{any_value}`, and that value will be displayed as part of the greeting.

### State Management in Blazor

State management in Blazor is typically accomplished through a combination of techniques, depending on the needs of your application.

* **Component state**: The simplest form of state is component state, where data is stored in fields and properties within the component. This is useful for transient state that is not shared outside of the component.

* **Service state**: Blazor services, which are registered with the dependency injection (DI) system and shared across multiple components, can also hold state. This is useful for sharing state across multiple components or preserving state across navigation events.

* **Browser state**: State can also be stored in the browser itself, using mechanisms like local storage or session storage. This state can survive across multiple browser sessions.

Here is an example of a simple counter component using component state:

```csharp
<button @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>
<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

In this example, `currentCount` is the component's state, which changes whenever the button is clicked.

### Interaction with JavaScript in Blazor

Even though Blazor aims to minimize the use of JavaScript by allowing developers to write client-side logic in C#, there might be cases where you need to interact with JavaScript libraries. Blazor provides a way to interoperate with JavaScript using the IJSRuntime interface.

For example, to call a JavaScript function `showAlert(message)` from Blazor, you could use:

```csharp
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime

<button @onclick="ShowAlert">Show Alert</button>

@code {
    private async Task ShowAlert()
    {
        await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("showAlert", "Hello from Blazor");
    }
}
```

In the above code, IJSRuntime is used to call the JavaScript function `showAlert()` from the Blazor component.

## WebAssembly's Future and Potential

WebAssembly (WASM) is a groundbreaking technology that has already begun to alter the web development landscape, and its potential uses stretch far beyond the confines of traditional web development.

### WebAssembly and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web technologies to provide a user experience as close as possible to that of native apps. This includes offline capabilities, push notifications, and even installation on the home screen of a device.

WebAssembly fits right into the concept of PWAs as it allows the use of more powerful languages than JavaScript on the web, potentially providing better performance and using less bandwidth. For example, with Blazor WebAssembly, you can write a fullstack application using C#, which can be executed directly in the browser, independent of the backend.

### WebAssembly and the Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network of physical objects&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;"things"&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.

With WebAssembly, developers can write IoT device code in multiple languages, opening up IoT programming to a wider range of developers. The runtime safety guarantees of WebAssembly also provide a secure way to run untrusted code on IoT devices.

### WebAssembly in Gaming

WebAssembly is opening up the web to game developers in a way that wasn't possible before. By allowing games to be written in languages like C++ and Rust, WASM can run game code at near-native speed in the browser.

For example, Unity, the popular game development platform, now has an option to export games directly to WebAssembly via its WebGL target, making them playable in the browser without the need for plugins.

Although WebAssembly is still in its early days, it has the potential to fundamentally change how we develop for the web and beyond. It opens up the web platform to a wider array of developers than ever before, making it possible to develop performant, secure applications in a multitude of programming languages.

### The Role of WebAssembly in Edge Computing, Blockchain, and Other Emerging Fields

WebAssembly's portability and security make it suitable for edge computing, which involves executing code closer to the data source (like on IoT devices). Cloudflare Workers and Fastly's Compute@Edge, for instance, use WebAssembly for their edge computing solutions.

In the blockchain space, Ethereum 2.0 is considering adopting WebAssembly as its execution engine. This would provide a more secure and efficient way to execute smart contracts.

## Getting Started with WebAssembly and Blazor

To start building applications with WebAssembly and Blazor, you need to set up your environment first.

### Setting up Your Environment for WebAssembly and Blazor

First, you need to install .NET Core SDK. You can download the latest version of the .NET Core SDK from the official .NET Core downloads page. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, MacOS, or Linux).

Secondly, you need an integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular choice and it supports Blazor development. It can be downloaded from the official VS Code downloads page.

Next, install the C# extension for Visual Studio Code, which provides rich support for .NET development. You can find it in the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on MacOS), then search for 'C#'.

Finally, install the Blazor templates for .NET. In your terminal or command prompt, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates::3.1.0
```

With these steps, you're ready to start developing with Blazor.

### Building Your First WebAssembly App with Blazor

Now, let's create a new Blazor WebAssembly project. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your preferred working directory, and type the following command:

```bash
dotnet new blazorwasm -o FirstBlazorApp
```

This creates a new Blazor WebAssembly project in a new directory called FirstBlazorApp.

Navigate to the new directory:

```bash
cd FirstBlazorApp
```

Run the app with the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

By default, the app is hosted at `https://localhost:5001/` and `http://localhost:5000/`. Open your web browser and navigate to one of these URLs. You should see a simple web application with a few pages.

In conclusion, WebAssembly, though relatively recent, is already deeply relevant to fullstack development. The necessity to master another programming language, such as C#, C++, or Rust, to tap into its full capabilities may initially seem daunting. However, the advantages it offers suggest that the invested effort could pay off significantly in the long run.
